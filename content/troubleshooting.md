# Issues

### Format
#### There is an error in the auto-generated Format stub
Usually, that error can be solved by left-clicking where the line of the error is and following the proposal from Eclipse to implement unimplemented methods.

### Scope
##### AbstractSmallJavaRuntime has missing classes for SmallJavaFingerprintComputer...
This can be solved by adding a .scope file under the grammar name (in this case, `SmallJava.scope`).
